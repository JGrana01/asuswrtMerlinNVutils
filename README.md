Some utilites to examine nvram on Asus Routers

Trying to make sense of all the nvram variables on Asuswrt-Merlin Asus routers
Martinksi has written a new SaveRestore script - these utils are some that I am using to figure out what nvram variables I need
to save for a later restore (after a Factory Device Reset).
